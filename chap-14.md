# 14: Acids and Bases

## Definition of Acids and Bases

---

### Amphoteric
Act as **acid and base**.

---

### Arrhenius Model
Acids release H+ when (aq)  
Bases release OH- when (aq)

---

### Bronsted-Lowry Model
Acids release H+  
Bases accept H+

---

### Conjugate Acids & Bases

B- <=> HB

B- is conjugate base of HB  
HB is conjugate acid of B-

---

### Water
Amphoteric  
**Self-ionization**: H2O <=> H+ + OH-

---

## Strength & Acidity

---
### Acid Strength
| Strong | Weak |
|--------|------|
| HCl, HBr, HI (halides) | HF   |
| HNO3 | HNO2 |
| H2SO4 | HSO4- |
| HClO3, HClO4 | HClO2 |

---

### Base Strength
| Strong | Weak |
|--------|------|
| NaOH, Ca(OH)2 (hydroxides) | NH3, etc. (everything else) |

---

### Conjugate Acid & Base Strength
strong acid : weak conjugate base  
strong base : weak conjugate acid

---

### Salts Strength
strong acid + strong base : Ka = Kb : neutral salt  
strong acid + weak base : Ka > Kb : acidic salt  
weak acid + strong base : Kb > Ka : basic salt  
highly charged metallic ion  : acidic salt

---

### HXOn Acid Strength 
For an acid like HXOn:  
 - more O : more acidic
 - high X electronegativity : more acidic

---

### Oxide Strength
nonmetal : acidic oxides  
metallic : basic oxides

---

## pH & Equilibrium Constants

---

### Ka
HA <=> H+ + A-  
Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA]

High Ka = strong acid

---

### Kb
B- + H2O <=> BH + OH-  
Kb = [BH][OH-]/[B-]

High Kb = strong base

---

### Kw
Kw = 1.0 * 10^-14 = [H+][OH-] = Ka * Kb

---

### pH & pOH
pH = -log[H+]  
pOH = -log[OH-]  
pH + pOH = 14

---

### Percent Dissociation
% dissociation = disociated conccentration / initial concentration

---

### Polyprotic Acids
Ka1 > Ka2 > Ka3

For H2SO4, Ka1 : H2SO4 :: Ka2 : HSO4-
