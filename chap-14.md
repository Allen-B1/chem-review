# 14: Acids and Bases

## Definition of Acids and Bases

---

### Amphoteric
Act as **acid and base**.

---

### Arrhenius Model
Acids release H+ when (aq)
Bases release OH- when (aq)

---

### Bronsted-Lowry Model
Acids release H+
Bases accept H+

---

### Conjugate Acids & Bases

B- <=> HB

B- is conjugate base of HB
HB is conjugate acid of B-

---

### Water
Amphoteric  
**Self-ionization**: H2O <=> H+ + OH-

---

## pH & Equilibrium Constants

---

### Ka
HA <=> H+ + A-

Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA]

---

### Kb
B- + H2O <=> BH + OH-

Kb = [BH][OH-]/[B-]

---

### Kw
Kw = 1.0 * 10^-14 = [H+][OH-] = Ka * Kb

---

### pH & pOH
pH = -log[H+]
pOH = -log[OH-]
pH + pOH = 14
