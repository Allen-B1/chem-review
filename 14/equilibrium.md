## Law of Mass Action
2A + 3B <=> 4C + 5D

**K = \[C]^4 \[D]^5 / \[A]^2 \[B]^3**
 * only include (aq) and (g)

### Ka
HA <=> H+ + A-

### Kb
B + H2O (l) <=> HB+ + OH-

### Ksp
disasociation reaction into all ions

### Kw
H2O <=> H+ + OH-

## Manipulation of K
### Reverse Reaction
new K = K^-1

### Multiplication of Coefficients
new K = K^n, where n = factor to that coefficients were multiplied by

### Addition of Multiple Reactions
new K = K1 * K2
